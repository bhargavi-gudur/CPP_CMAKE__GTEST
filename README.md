# Four Different Basic Projects

This repository contains four different basic projects related to C and C++ programming. Below is a brief description of each project:

## CPP_CMAKE
This project demonstrates the use of CMake to build and manage C++ projects. It includes examples of how to structure a C++ project, write a `CMakeLists.txt` file, and build the project using CMake.

## CPP_Codes
This folder contains standalone C++ programs showcasing various concepts of C++ programming, such as object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## CPP_Gtest_Cmake
This project integrates Google Test (GTest) with CMake to demonstrate unit testing in C++ projects. It includes sample test cases and instructions on how to run the tests.

## cprogramming
This folder contains basic C programs that cover fundamental concepts of the C programming language, such as loops, functions, pointers, and file handling.
